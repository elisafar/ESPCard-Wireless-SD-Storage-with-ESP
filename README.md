# 🚀 ESPCard Project

ESPCard is an ESP8266-based project that enables data transfer to an SD card over an access point.

⚠️ This project is a work in progress. The current implementation has slow data transfer speeds. Users are encouraged to explore optimizations, use different MCUs, or add new features! 🔧💡

## ✨ Features

- 📂 Data transfer to SD card via ESP8266 access point
- 🌐 Simple web interface for sending data
- 🔄 Open for improvements and modifications

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Upload the code to your ESP8266 using Arduino IDE or PlatformIO. 🚀

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

- 🕒 Fix incorrect date issue for transferred files
- ⚡ Optimize data transfer speed
- 🔄 Support for different MCUs (ESP32, STM32, etc.)
- 🔒 Additional features like file management or encryption
